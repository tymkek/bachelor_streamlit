      "question": "What distinguishes a 'sigma male' from alpha and beta males?",

Unlike alphas and betas, sigmas are self-sufficient, prioritize self-improvement, and may avoid traditional social structures. The sigma male concept has been popularized as someone more masculine than an alpha because of their focus on self-development, often at the expense of social interactions."

      "question": "What is the author's main criticism of the sigma male phenomenon?",
      "answer": "The author criticizes the sigma male phenomenon for romanticizing loneliness and fostering a toxic mindset that promotes isolation as 'cool' or a 'sigma mindset.'
