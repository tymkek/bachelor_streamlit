# Streamlit survey site

The app conducts a short test made out of 5 questions, based on chosen by user text. Questions are predetermined. The data is gathered to later be evaluated by LLM on a scale: "excellent", "good", "average", "bad", "very bad". Experiment is being done as a part of my bachelor degree project called *"Evaluation of human knowledge with LLM and human feedback"*.

# Fundamentals

App consists of several pages such as: **home_page**, **choose_page**, **text_page**, **questions_page**.
